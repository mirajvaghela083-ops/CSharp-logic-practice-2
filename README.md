# LogicBuildPractice 🧠💻

This repository contains a collection of **C# console programs** focused on building strong programming logic using loops, conditions, and basic problem-solving techniques. These exercises are designed for beginners and students who want to improve their understanding of core programming concepts in **.NET (Console Applications)**.

## 📌 About This Project

The goal of this project is to practice and master:

* Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
* Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
* User input and output
* Mathematical logic
* Clean coding and Git commit habits

Each program solves a **specific logic-based problem** and is written in a simple, easy-to-understand format.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** C#
* **Framework:** .NET (Console App)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Community
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📘 List of Logic Programs

1. Print all numbers from **1 to 10**
2. Print the **multiplication table** of a given number
3. Keep taking numbers until **0 is entered**, then print the **sum of all entered numbers**
4. Keep taking numbers until **0 is entered**, then print the **largest number**
5. Count and print the **number of digits** in a given number
6. **Reverse** a given number
7. Check whether a number is a **Palindrome**
8. Check whether a number is an **Armstrong Number**
9. Calculate the **Factorial** of a given number
10. Print the **Fibonacci Series** up to required terms
11. Find the **HCF (Highest Common Factor)** of given numbers
12. Create a **Menu-Driven Program** for multiple operations
13. Count how many **positive numbers** were entered before a **negative number**
14. Find the **sum of digits** of a given number
15. Calculate the **sum of even digits** and **sum of odd digits** separately

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio Community**
2. Select the `.cs` file you want to test
3. Set it as the **Startup Object** (if needed)
4. Press `Ctrl + F5` to run the program

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing these programs, you will:

* Understand loop control clearly
* Improve problem-solving skills
* Write clean and readable C# code
* Gain confidence in handling user input
* Build a strong foundation for **.NET Development**
